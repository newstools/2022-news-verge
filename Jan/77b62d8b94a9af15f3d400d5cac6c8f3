Russia is not planning to launch an attack against Ukraine, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said on Wednesday. “We do not intend to take any aggressive action. We will not attack and invade Ukraine,” Ryabkov told the Valdai Discussion Club. The diplomat noted that Russia was not taking any action that threatens Ukraine’s security. “We only conduct exercises, regular troop movements on our own territory,” the official said. Russia would do everything possible to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO by diplomatic means, he added.
