Mr Rufus Bature, Chairman, All Progressives Congress in Plateau, has enjoined the local governments’ chairmen in the 17 local governments of Plateau to embrace peer review mechanism for effective synergy towards achieving virile grassroots  development. In a statement issued in Jos on Thursday by the Plateau APC Publicity Secretary, Mr Sylvanus Namang,  Bature gave the advice in a congratulatory message to all the elected local government council chairmen and councillors in the local governments. Bature said in the statement that chairmen and councillors should work in unison, replicate and consolidate on the gains of  Gov. Simon Lalong’s administration in their various local government areas. He called on the local government chairmen, under the auspices of Association of Local Governments of Nigeria, on the need for working toward achieving common goals for the good of the citizenry. “The APC encourages  the provision of dividends of democracy on a competitive basis among the local governments as the people at the grassroots need to feel the impact of governance.” “As a party, we are satisfied with the  performances of the elected local government chairmen so far, especially the relative peace and stability that is being witnessed in the state.” “We appeal to the electorate to be patient and allow them to work for the  collective interest of the people of their domains instead of soliciting patronage and personal gains,” he said.
