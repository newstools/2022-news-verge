Zambian referee Janny Sikazwe has come under fire after a series of shocking decisions in the Africa Cup of Nations Group F match between Mali and Tunisia at the Stade Municipal de Limbe in Cameroon on Wednesday.  Sikazwe overruled VAR to stick to his decision to issue a red card to Mali’s El Bilal Touré, ending the match in the 86th minute, resuming and again ending it in the 89th minute.  “He must have got his watch from a very cheap place; it couldn’t have been an expensive watch. You cannot be allowing something like this to be happening in a tournament of this magnitude” said Gavin Hunt.
