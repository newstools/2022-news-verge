The Plateau chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says the party has a timetable from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the House of Representatives and State Assembly bye-elections in the state. Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency and Pankshin State Constituency seats became vacant following the demise of the occupants of seats. INEC has slated Feb. 26 for a bye-election to fill the vacancies. Mr John Akans, the PDP Publicity Secretary in Plateau, told our correspondent in Jos that the party had received INEC timetable for the elections and that “PDP is ready for the elections. “We have long prepared ourselves and have been waiting for the election.” “Our primaries will be conducted immediately begining next week in line with the INEC timetable.” “The sale of nomination forms is ongoing at the state and federal secretariats of the party  and will close on Jan. 21.” “After the submission of the forms, they will avail themselves for screening.” The publicity secretary said that the party was exploring the option of consensus for the candidates to emerge. He, however, said that in an event that the option failed, the party would conduct a primary elections for the contestants.
