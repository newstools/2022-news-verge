Lionel Messi is set to return to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) after testing negative for COVID-19. The Ligue 1 leaders announced on Sunday that the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner had returned a positive test while back home in Argentina. Messi subsequently missed the commanding 4-0 win over Vannes in the Coupe de France on Monday, with Kylian Mbappe scoring a hat-trick at Stade de la Rabine. But the club has revealed the Argentina international tested negative on Wednesday and could be available for this weekend’s trip to Lyon. Mauricio Pochettino will be without Layvin Kurzawa, who returned a positive test and has been placed in isolation. Messi has struggled to find his feet in Ligue 1 since making his sensational switch from FC Barcelona in August. He has been directly involved in 10 goals (six goals, four assists) from 16 appearances across all competitions. But the 34-year-old has only found the net once in 11 games in the French top-flight.
