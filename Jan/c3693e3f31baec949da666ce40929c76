A 30-year-old housewife, Fulera Lawal, on Wednesday prayed a Shari’a Court in Magajin Gari, Kaduna to order her husband, Kabir Abdulhamid, to pay her two years arrears of feeding allowance. Lawal, who resides in Doka area of Kaduna, told the court that Abdulhamid abandoned her in her parent’s house in 2020. She said her parents had been providing for her and their son. Lawal also prayed the court to order Abdulhamid to henceforth take full responsibility for his child. The judge, Murtala Nasir, directed Lawal to calculate the amount she’s seeking as feeding allowance for the two years. Nasir adjourned the matter to Jan. 19 to enable Lawal to specify the amount she was asking for. Our correspondent reports that Abdulhamid was in court but was not asked to respond due to the complainant’s failure to clearly specify her prayers.
