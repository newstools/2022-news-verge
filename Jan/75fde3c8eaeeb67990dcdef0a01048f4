Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Sunday evening held a closed-door meeting with members of the Nigerian Association of Nurses and Midwives (NANNM), Lagos State Council. The meeting held at the Lagos House Marine was to address the grievances of the nursing workforce in the state. At the end of the two hours meeting, both the government and the union agreed on a number of issues that had been causing disaffection between the two parties. Sanwo-Olu pledged government’s sincerity in the implementation of all that was agreed on, to the delight of the representatives of the nurses. ”We prioritise quality healthcare delivery in Lagos State and our nurses are very important to achieving our objective,” he said. On his part, the Chairman, Lagos State Council of the Nigerian Association of Nurses and Midwives, Mr Olurotimi Awojide, thanked Gov. Sanwo-Olu for acceding to most of their requests. Awojide described the governor as a true leader and father who cared about his children. He promised to call an emergency congress of the association on Monday, where the union would announce its decision to call off the planned industrial action. Recall that NANNM, Lagos State Council, had ordered its members to embark on a three-day warning strike from Jan. 10, over unmet demands by the Lagos State Government.
