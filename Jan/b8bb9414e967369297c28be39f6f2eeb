Juventus scored three goals in seven second-half minutes to complete an astonishing comeback and beat AS Roma 4-3 on Sunday. And that was after goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny saved a late penalty kick to keep them in front at the Stadio Olimpico. Tammy Abraham put hosts Roma in front before Paulo Dybala made it 1-1 going into the break. Goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Lorenzo Pellegrini put Roma in charge early in the second half. Juve fought back as Manuel Locatelli and Dejan Kulusevski scored within two minutes of each other and Mattia De Sciglio fired home a fourth in the 77th minute. Roma were awarded a penalty kick after Matthijs de Ligt was shown a second yellow card for handball with nine minutes remaining. But Szczesny guessed the right way to save Pellegrini’s penalty kick in front of a stunned home crowd. Juventus moved up to 38 points in fifth place, six points ahead of eighth-placed Roma.
