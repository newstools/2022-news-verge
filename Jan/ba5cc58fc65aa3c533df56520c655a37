The former Zamfara Governor, Abdul’aziz Yari has commiserated with the victims of recent bandit’s attack in Anka and Bukkuyum local government areas of the state.  It was reported that Gov. Bello Matawalle during his visit to the affected communities on Saturday declared 58 persons killed during last Thursday’s bandits attack in the two LGAs. Yari, in a statement by the Chairman of his All Progressives Congress (APC) faction in the state, Alhaji Lawal Liman expressed the deepest condolences on behalf of the party leaders, stakeholders and members in 147 wards, 14 LGAs to the affected families, communities and survivors of the unfortunate attack. “The multiple effects of such barbarism will further plunge the larger society into a more critical situation with many people becoming refugees in their own land without food, clothes and shelter,” Yari said. He stressed the need for hands to be on deck and to support government at levels with a view to stemming the tide. He appealed to residents of the state to continue with special prayers for Allah’s intervention in the state and Nigeria in general. Yari prayed to Almighty Allah to grant the deceased Aljannatul Firdausi and give their family the fortitude to bear the loss.
