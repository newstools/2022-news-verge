A 39-year-old businessman, Peter Ayeni, charged with obtaining N1 million under false pretence was on Friday arraigned before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. The defendant, who resides at Dopemu, Lagos State, appeared before Magistrate Mrs O.A Dirisu, on a three- count charge of obtaining money under false pretence, stealing and issuing of dud cheque. Ayeni, however, denied committing the offences and was admitted to a bail of N250, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Dirisu said the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government (LASG). The Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Mojirade Edeme, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on Aug. 26, 2021 at Live Stock Feeds, Ikeja, Lagos State. She said the defendant obtained N1 million quick loan from D’Crown Loan Service with the pretext of paying back, a representation he knew to be false. “The defendant collected the money with an agreement to pay back within three months which he failed. “When the complainant started demanding for the money, the defendant issued him a cheque of N1million. “When the cheque was presented at the bank for payment, it was dishonoured due to no money in the defendant’s account. “The case was reported leading to the arrest of the defendant,” the prosecutor said. The alleged offences violate sections 287, 321 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. It was reported that section 287 stipulates three years’ imprisonment for stealing while section 314 prescribes 15 years for obtaining money under false pretence. The magistrate adjourned the case until Feb. 16, for mention.
