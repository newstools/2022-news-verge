Mr Bagarmi Tauwama, Director, Extension Service, Agricultural Development Project (ADP) in Adamawa, has advised unemployed youth to key into Agriculture to succeed in life. Tauwama give the advice in an interview with our correspondent in Yola on Friday. Tauwama, who said that Agriculture was now paying and that wealth was in the soil, stressed the need for the youth to have a rethink instead of waiting for white collar jobs. According to him, most of the youth who are already in the business are richer than some of the civil servants because of their commitment and understanding. “We have a lot of graduates looking for white collar jobs which are no longer available as before; I want to advise such youth to key into dry and wet season farming to succeed.” Like in Lamurde, Guyuk, and Shelleng Local Government Areas, most of these youth are richer than civil servants because they have engaged themselves in Agricultural activities for both rainy and dry seasons. “Most of these youth have gone into rice production and they are making it and some of them get more than 150 bags of rice each season.” “So, if youths engage in this they will not even think of white collar jobs because Agriculture is now paying and wealth is in the soil,” he said. The director further urged the youth to understand that even the civil servants were now going to the farms with their families for food. According to him, even those that are rich are also going back to farms to be richer.
