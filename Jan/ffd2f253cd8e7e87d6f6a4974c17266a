The Federal Road Safety Corps, (FRSC) has urged the public to disregard the trending video showing an erring tricycle rider and corps patrol team faceoff. The Corps Public Education Officer (CPEO) Mr Bisi Kazeem, said this in a statement on Monday in Abuja. ”This is a misrepresentation as the event did not just happen. The video was recorded in Benin, on the Benin/Sapele road on July, 16, 2020. ”The video showed an erring tricycle rider in a face off with FRSC patrol team, after he was caught destroying a patrol vehicle on the Sapele road Benin, Edo. “The Corps wishes to inform the general public that the incident did not just happen as purportedly misrepresented by social media operators. “The officer involved has been adequately disciplined in accordance with FRSC Regulations on Maintenance of Discipline at the instance of the Corps Marshal, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi and the outcome of the trial made public on Aug. 2, 2020. “As an organisation that does not condone indiscipline, the Corps has punished the said staff for being uncivil towards the tricycle rider. “This was so as to serve as deterrence and compel others to be tolerant, more professional and gentlemanly while handling traffic violators, ” he said. He warned the perpetrators of such media propaganda to desist from heating up the polity at this sensitive moment of the national development. It was reported that a Magistrates’ Court sitting in Benin city on Jan. 11 2021, sentenced the tricycle rider, Adeshina Adeyemo, to three months imprisonment for attacking the patrol operatives and damaging their vehicle. Adeyemo convicted of conduct in a manner likely to cause breach of public peace and malicious damage.
