The Council of Europe is preparing to formally expel Russia over its invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe voted to expel Russia after an emergency session in Strasbourg. The body’s ministerial committee is to hold a special meeting on Wednesday to prepare for the suspension. Russia on Tuesday said it had formally left the Council of Europe of its own volition over the unprecedented sanctions Moscow faces in the wake of its Ukraine campaign. The council’s secretary general received formal notification from Russia of its withdrawal, a spokesman confirmed. Based in the French city of Strasbourg, the 47-member Council of Europe monitors human rights and the rule of law. It is not part of the European Union.
The body reacted to Russia’s attack on Ukraine by suspending Russian membership to the Council of Europe in an unprecedented move.
