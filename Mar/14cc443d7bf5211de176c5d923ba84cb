Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on his country’s people to keep up the fight against Russian troops in the face of increasing violence against civilians. In a video message, Zelensky appealed to Ukrainians to do everything they could to protect the state. He called for the “invaders to be driven out so that Ukraine lives and we all live together with her, free and at peace.” He referred to the Russian military as “tourists with tanks” and “slaves to their propaganda, which has changed their consciousness.” He said the “slaves” sent by Russia had never seen so many free people in the streets and squares. “They have never seen thousands of people who are not afraid of them,” he said, referring to a rally of civilians in occupied Kherson. Russian troops reportedly broke it up at gunpoint on Monday. Zelensky said sorrow awaited all Russian soldiers who target Ukrainian civilians “Ukraine is not Russia,” he said. “Resistance does not need to be organised here, for Ukrainians, resistance is a quality of the soul,” he added.
