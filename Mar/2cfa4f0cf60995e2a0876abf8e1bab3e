The University of Calabar says it has postponed its 35th Convocation ceremony scheduled for March 25 and 26. In a statement on Tuesday in Calabar, the Registrar, Mr Gabriel Egbe, attributed the postponement to the ongoing Academic Staff Union of Universities’ (ASUU) strike. Egbe regretted the inconveniences it may have caused. He assured that a new date would be announced in due course. ASUU extended its ongoing strike by eight weeks on Monday after a four-week warning strike. According to the union, the extension was due to the failure of the government to implement the agreement it reached with the Federal Government in 2009. ASUU also accused the Federal Government of working against the deployment of the UTAS, a payment platform designed by ASUU in lieu of the IPPIS payment system.
