A 24-year-old man, Peter Orji, on Tuesday appeared before an Ikorodu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos State for allegedly assaulting IKEDC staff. Orji, of no fixed address, is facing a two-count charge of conduct likely to cause breach of peace and assault. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecutor, Insp. Christian Okonofua, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on Feb. 22, at about 10.00 p.m. at Ogunfowoke Street, Adekunle, Mile 12, Ikorodu road, Ikorodu, Lagos. Okonofua said the defendant allegedly conducted himself in a manner likely to cause breach of peace by raining abusive words on Ikeja Electric Distributor Company (IKEDC) staff, one Mrs Abiodun Iman. The prosecutor said the defendant also attempted to slap the complainant for directing him to clear his accumulated debt at IKEDC office. He said the offence contravened sections 168(1) and 170(B) punishable under sections 172(B) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 as amended. The Magistrate, Mrs T.A. Shotobi, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N100, 000 with one surety in like sum. The magistrate adjourned the case until May 19 for mention.
