Delay in advice by Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions on Monday stalled proceedings in the murder case involving Lagos Island Branch B Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers. The case before a Yaba Chief Magistrate’s Court has been further adjourned until April 4. The chairman, Azeez Lawal (a.k.a Kunle Poly), aged 48, and one Adekanbi Wahab, aged 38, were on Jan. 27 brought on a three-count of conspiracy to commit murder, murder and membership of secret cult. The charge was read to the defendants but their pleas were not taken. The alleged offences contravene Section 233 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, and Section 3 of the Anti-cultism Law of Lagos State, 2021. On Monday, the Chief Magistrate, Mrs Linda Balogun, further adjourned the case for the DPP advice. She directed a lawyer from the directorate, Mrs O. R.
