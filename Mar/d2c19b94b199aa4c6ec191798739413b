A former Governor of Lagos State, Sen. Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday cancelled the 13th edition of a Colloquium for his birthday, in honour of the victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack. Tinubu who spoke immediately after the National Anthem was recited to commence the programme, said that he should not be celebrating his 70th birthday, while the country was in a sober mood. He called for a minute silence, in honour of the victims, while urging that the citizens continued to pray for the country. Before the cancellation of the programme, the Chief Imam of Lagos, Sheikh Sulaiman Abou-Nolla and the Chairman, Christian Association of Nigeria (Lagos), His Lordship Bishop Stephen Adegbite, had taken the opening prayer. Tinubu described the incident as a national tragedy, saying it called for sober reflection and not celebration. ”I have just been informed about the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, which happened last night and I am very sad. This calls for sober reflection and not rejoicing at this time. ”This event should not be holding. I hereby cancel this colloquium due to the incident in Kaduna. To be here dancing and celebrating doesn’t show enough concerns as a senior citizen. ”We pray for the souls of those who have departed prematurely. We pray Almighty God will help us to win the war against evil, set Nigeria on the right path, bless us and provide guidance for all of us in various ways,” he said. In his address, before the cancellation of the programme, CAN Chairman, Adegbite had said that Tinubu was generous to a fault. ”Asiwaju you are generous to a fault, that is why we cannot but have you. The Lord will continue to give you good health,” he said.
