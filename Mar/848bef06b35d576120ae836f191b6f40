A 50-year-old widow, Sahura Sulaiman, on Tuesday dragged her co-wife, Umma Sulaiman, to a Shari’a Court sitting at Rigasa Kaduna, over her share of what their late husband left behind. The complainant, who resides at Cinema road, Rigasa, told the court that her husband died in 2019 leaving behind two wives and children. The woman said that since their husband’s death, her co-wife had refused to release what was due to her as inheritance, nor paid off the debts he owed while alive. “She had refused to give me my share of the inheritance and had also refused to pay some debt owed by our late husband. “Our husband had a house which we all lived in and his pension had been coming, but I was given only N3,000 once,” she said. The complainant said she had no child with the deceased and prayed the court to intervene in the matter and grant her Justice. Our correspondent reports that the defendant was not in court and did not send any representative. The judge, Malam Salisu Abubakar-Tureta, ordered that the defendant be served a reminder and and adjourned the case to April 13, for hearing.
