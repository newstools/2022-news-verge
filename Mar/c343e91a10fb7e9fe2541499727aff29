The war in Syria must be stopped and those responsible for unconscionable human losses must be held accountable, UN Secretary-General,  Antonio Guterres said on Friday. Israeli warplanes attacked the Syrian capital on Monday morning while in Lebanese airspace. One of the missiles fell in a village south of Damascus, hitting a residential building and killing two civilians. According to Iranian reports, the strike also killed two soldiers of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps. “11 years of horrific war has devastated Syria and its people, exacting an unconscionable human cost. “The conflict must cease. There must be no impunity. We cannot fail the Syrian people,” Guterres tweeted. Israel carries out occasional airstrikes on Syria, saying those were aimed at the Iranian military presence in the Arab republic. Damascus condemned such attacks as violations of Syrian sovereignty. The Syrian war had been going on since 2011, with President Bashar Assad’s forces fighting against different insurgent groups. The ongoing conflict made millions of the country’s nationals flee to other countries to save their lives.
