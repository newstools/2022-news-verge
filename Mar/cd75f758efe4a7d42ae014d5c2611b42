Spain will supply Ukraine with offensive weapons as Russia continues its special operation, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday. “I want to declare that Spain will also transfer offensive weapons to the Ukrainian resistance,” Sanchez told lawmakers. “We have always coordinated actions at the European level.” “Therefore, we support the activation of the European Peace Facility for the supply of defensive and offensive weapons by the European Union to Ukraine.” “ Spain is the fourth donor to this fund.” “That was my position and the position of the Spanish government and I think it is adequate,” he added.
