New Zealand will fully open its border to the world from July 31, two months earlier than expected, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Wednesday. The country closed its border to almost all travellers in March 2020. “New Zealand is in demand and now fully open for business,” Ardern said. The final part of the border reopening means the country will open for all travellers needing visas – including tourists, workers, families and students. The maritime border will also reopen, allowing cruise ships to visit the country. From May 1, vaccinated travellers from visa-waiver countries, including Germany and Britain, were able to enter New Zealand. Visitors must undergo a COVID-19 test before departure and upon arrival but do not need to self-isolate. The prime minister said covid monitoring would continue at the border at present. Ardern, however, said she is “confident” pre-departure testing would be scrapped by July 31. New Zealand, a country of some five million people, has reported more than one million cases of COVID-19 and about 800 deaths since the onset of the pandemic.
