A High Court in Zaria, Kaduna on Thursday ordered Alhaji Faruk Maiyama the National Chairman of the Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) and four others to appear on June 22. The four others ordered to appear are the Alhaji Suleiman Argungu, Chairman Zone 14 PCRC Caretaker Committee; Umar Suleiman, Chairman PCRC Kaduna State and Dr Abubakar Ahmed PCRC Chairman Electoral Committee Zone 14. Some PCRC members, Auwal Ibrahim, Samaila Hamza, Abdu Sule, Abdul Hassan and Alhaji Sani Kola approached the court seeking for an order commuting the respondents to prison for violating the Court order granted on Jan. 26. Our correspondent reports that the plaintiffs obtained an order of interim injunction restraining the respondents from conducting any elections for zone 14 of the PCRC pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice. The plaintiffs through their counsel Mr A.T. Abubakar and Associate told the court that the respondents went ahead and conducted the election in defiance of the court order granted on Jan 26. Our correspondent also reports that neither the respondents nor their counsel was in court on Thursday. However, Ms Halima Olodo, Counsel for the plaintiffs told the court that the first, second and Fourth respondents were served with all processes. “My Lord, Argungu and Ahmed are yet to be served. In the circumstances I apply that the third and fifth respondents be served on substituted service,” she said. The presiding judge, Justice Kabiru Dabo said the application cannot be granted orally but through an exparte motion. Dabo therefore ordered that the plaintiffs should reappear before June 22 for the exparte application. He adjourned the matter until June 22.
