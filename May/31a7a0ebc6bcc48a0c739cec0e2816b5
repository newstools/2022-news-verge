At the end of the match, the number four-ranked Oribamise told NAN that she was happy to have won the match in spite of her opponent’s quality. “I am happy that I won the match. When I found out that I was going to play against Ojomu, I decided to work harder and improve myself and I am happy I made it. “She is a good player and I wish her well in her career,” Oribamise said. “My previous matches here were tough, but this particular match was tougher because we (she and Ojomu) always meet each other at this difficult stage of round of 16,” she added.
