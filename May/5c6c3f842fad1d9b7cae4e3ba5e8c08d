Osun government says it has taken over the rehabilitation of the Osogbo-Okinni-Ilobu federal road to alleviate the sufferings of road users. The government stated in Osogbo on Tuesday that the Federal Government awarded contracts for the rehabilitation of the road twice since 2012, but that nothing concrete had been done. “Two contracts for rehabilitating the road were awarded by the Federal Government since 10 years ago. “Since then, no significant work has been done on the road and that has caused so much hardship for our people. “It was for this reason that the Gov. Gboyega Oyetola administration took over the project to address the needless sufferings and loss of man-hour on the facility,” Mr Ismail Omipidan, the governor’s spokesman stated. He added that the benefiting communities and road users were happy with the state government’s decision. He noted that the facility had been in a deplorable condition for too long and the state government could not afford to allow residents to continue to suffer on the road. Omipidan stated also that due processes were followed in taking over the project from the Federal Government.
