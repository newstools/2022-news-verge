A Kaduna Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday remanded a 45-year-old carpenter, Musa Garba, who allegedly defiled a 12-year-old girl. The Magistrate, Mrs Blessing Stephen, who did not take Garba’s plea, ordered that he should be remanded in a custodial centre. Stephen directed the police to send the case file to the state Director of Public Prosecutions for advice. She adjourned the case until June 16 for mention. Garba, who resides at Samaru, Zaria, Kaduna, State, is charged with defilement. According to the prosecutor, Insp Sunday Baba,  Garba had sexual intercourse with the minor on April 19 at 8.00 p.m. at Hayin Dogo, Samaru, Zaria. Baba said that the defendant was arrested when the girl told her mother of the alleged crime. He noted that the offence contravened Section 258 of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, 2017.
