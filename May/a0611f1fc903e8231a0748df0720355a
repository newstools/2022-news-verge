A contingent of 22 players of the national under-17 women football team will be heading to Addis Ababa on Wednesday, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) said on Monday. “The team’s Head Coach, Bankole Olowookere, has picked 22 players for Friday’s FIFA Under-17 Women’s World Cup qualifying final round first leg match between Nigeria and Ethiopia in Addis Ababa,” NFF’s Head of Communications, Ademola Olajire, said in a statement. Our correspondent reports that the Flamingos are facing the final hurdle in the qualifying series with this fixture. They had home and away victories over the Democratic Republic of Congo and Egypt in the previous round for a 6-0 aggregate, and had earlier defeated DR Congo 8-0 on aggregate. Now they have a final hurdle to negotiate against a team that sensationally sent South Africa’s Bantwana packing with a 3-0 win in Johannesburg. Friday’s match will hold at the Abebe Bekila Stadium in Addis Ababa, starting from 4 p.m. Ethiopia time (2 p.m. Nigeria time) and will be handled by Namibian officials. Our correspondent reports that the return leg is already scheduled for the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja on June 4.
