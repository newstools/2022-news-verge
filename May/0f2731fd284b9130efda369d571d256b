The Management of Federal Polytechnic, Ede, has debunked reports of increment in school fees for all students of the institution. The Protocol, Media and Public Relations Officer of the institution, Mr Sola Lawal, made the clarification in a statement on Sunday in Osogbo. Lawal described the allegation as baseless and callous. The spokesman of the institution said the allegation that the management of the school increased school fees by 100 per cent was not true. According to him, the increment on school fees is for new students that are due to resume in June, and that the increase was by only 30 per cent
Lawal said the old students were not in any way affected by the increment. “The misinformation that 100 per cent increment was made for all students is not only unfounded, but wicked and unthinkable. “As a matter of fact, the Polytechnic website/student portal has correct school fees structures for all levels of students. “Indeed, we are not unaware of the unfriendly economic season, that is why the increase was pegged at 30 per cent. “Even at that, it is still the lowest in the zone, and only for those that are coming in newly. “The simple analysis of the pattern of payment is that, old students that are paying N32, 000, will continue paying the amount till graduation,” he said. Lawal said there were however, wide consultations with critical stakeholders, including student union leadership before final approval of the 30 per cent increase in new students fees by the Governing Council.
