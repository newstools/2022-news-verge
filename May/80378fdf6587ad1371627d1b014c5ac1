An Ikeja Special Offences Court on Tuesday dismissed the no-case-submission applications filed by two oil marketers charged with receiving $8.4 million from oil theft. The defendants, Yusuf Yaya Kwande and Osahon Asemota and their companies are being prosecuted by the Police Special Fraud Unit (SFU). Our correspondent reports that the companies are: Trafigua Behee BV, Trafigura PTE, Mettle Energy and Gas Ltd, Rembrandt Ltd and Jill Engineering and Oil Services Ltd. At the resumed hearing of the case today, Justice Mojisola Dada affirmed that the prosecution had established a prima facie case against all the defendants. Dada said: “upon review of applications of all defendants, there is need for them to explain their role in allegations preferred against them by the prosecution. “The prosecution had established a sufficient prima facie case against the defendants. “The case is hereby adjourned until Oct. 4 for the defendants to open their defence,” Dada ruled. According to the SFU prosecutor, Mr G.O. Balogun, the defendants are facing a three-count charge bordering on conspiracy and receiving stolen property.
