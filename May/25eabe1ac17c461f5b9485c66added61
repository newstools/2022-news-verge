The Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) has described workers as the backbone of the nation, saying that workers should be recognized and celebrated. The National Chairman of the PRP, Alhaji Falalu Bello, made the statement in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja on Monday, to commemorate Workers’ Day. Bello said that the resilience shown by Nigerian workers in the face of economic hardships, insecurity and other challenges bedeviling the nation was worth celebrating. “PRP wishes to express gratitude and respect to all Nigerian workers on the occasion of this year’s Labour Day. “PRP as the party of the masses, particularly workers, hold workers in high esteem in view of the fact that workers are a nation’s essential backbone and through them a nation can survive and prosper. “Nigerian workers deserve to be appreciated and celebrated for giving their best, in spite of the unfavourable tough working condition.” The party stalwart urged workers across the country to ensure they got registered in the ongoing voter’s registration to get their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). According to him, getting PVC and exercising your civic responsibility of casting your vote in the 2023 general elections is the only way to salvage Nigeria from the scourge of maladministration.
