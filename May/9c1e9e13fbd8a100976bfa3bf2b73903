The Inspector-General of Police (I-G), Mr Usman Baba, has ordered adequate deployment of Police officers and other operational assets of the Force nationwide ahead of the 2022 Eid-el-Fitri celebration nationwide. The Force Public Relations Officer, CPS Olumuyiwa Adejobi, said this in a statement on Sunday, in Abuja. He directed that Eid praying grounds, highways, recreational centres and financial institutions, especially ATM and POS points be accorded priority in the deployment. Baba said the deployment was to ensure adequate security and safeguard religious celebrations and financial transactions during the festive period. According to him, the order to Strategic Police Managers at various levels is predicated on the need to maintain a more secured public and social space for the celebration. The I-G ordered that all personnel deployed for the assignment must be properly briefed and adequately supervised. He said the idea was to ensure that officers were proactive, visible in patrol  and professional in the discharge of policing services to all and sundry. Baba called on all State Commissioners of Police and their supervisory Assistant Inspectors-General of Police to ensure that crime and criminality were put in check and brought to its lowest level. The I-G felicitates with all Muslim faithful in the country as they join the global Muslim Ummah to mark the 2022 Eid-el-Fitr. He urged the Muslims to put into practice, the values of empathy, faith, charity and other salient teachings of Ramadan in their relationship with others in the society.
