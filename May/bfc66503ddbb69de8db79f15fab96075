A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Aspirant, Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim, has promised a blueprint on economy that is inclusive for the youths, women and Nigerians in Diaspora. Anyim, at a meeting with the PDP delegates from Kogi State in Abuja on Friday, said that he realised that Nigerian women were well trained and professionalised but lacked the opportunity to actualise their potential. He said that when elected, he would give women the opportunity to be involved in economic development, the way it was under former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration. “I want to assure you that Nigerian youths will fit into our programme that prepares Nigeria into fourth industrial revolution. “Our programme will Identify the talented ones and upgrade them; identify the less privileged ones, train and support them with venture capitals and startup funds to be on their own and dignify their works,” he said. He said that his administration would also mainstream Nigerians in Diaspora into the development of the country. He said that his administration would also restructure and overhaul education system to make it one of the best in the world, as well ensure that no Nigerian child is out of school. He added that his administration would develop smart cities in contiguous states around Abuja, to reduce the inflow of persons into the capital territory. Anyim said that when elected, he would ensure that Ajaokuta Steel Complex in Kogi stage was reviewed and functional. He also said that given the right leadership, Kogi State with its endowed mineral resources, would be most outstanding industrial hub in the country.
