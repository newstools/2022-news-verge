Gov. Hope Uzodimma of Imo on Wednesday, expressed sadness over the death of the Secretary-General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr Muhammad Sanusi Barkindo. Barkindo, 63 year-old oil diplomat, reportedly died Tuesday night in Abuja, same day he paid a courtesy call on President Muhammadu Buhari to brief him on his tenure that was about to end at OPEC. In a statement signed by Mr Oguwike Nwachuku, the Chief Press Secretary and Media Adviser to the governor, Uzodimma described the death as “shocking, unbelievable and unfortunate”. “Barkindo was a prominent Nigerian professional, who devoted his time and energy in the service of the country both nationally and internationally. “Barkindo died when his services are still required in the country because of his vast knowledge in private and public administration as well as in the oil and gas industry,” Uzodimma said. The governor commiserated with the immediate and extended family, friends and associates of the deceased and prayed God to grant them the grace and fortitude to bear the unexpected loss. The governor also prayed God to grant the soul of the deceased a peaceful repose. Barkindo had headed OPEC since 2016 and was scheduled to be replaced by Kuwait’s Haitham Al-Ghais in August.
