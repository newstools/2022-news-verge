The House of Representatives has applauded Air peace on the commencement of direct flight between Nigeria and China. The airline’s Spokesperson, Mr Stanley Olisa made this known in a statement issued in Lagos on Friday. It was reported that Air Peace on Wednesday announced its official commencement of flight operations into Guangzhou-China, becoming the first Nigerian airline to fly into the Asian country once every week. The Chairman, House Committee on Aviation, Rep. Nnolim Nnaji, said that the commencement of direct flight to China would bring a huge relief to Nigerians and citizens of other African countries who travel regularly on business trips to China. He said: “Nigeria and indeed Africa share huge business and cultural ties and the direct air link will further strengthen such relationships. “I want to praise Air Peace for mustering the courage to begin the long haul flight. “Especially at this time the entire airlines globally are struggling to overcome the enormous negative impact of COVID-19 on the aviation sector”. Nnaji assured that the legislature would continue to work with the executive to ensure a robust aviation industry in the country.
