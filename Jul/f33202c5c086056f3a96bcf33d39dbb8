Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin, President, Women Arise for Change Initiative, says the outcome of Saturday’s governorship election in Osun reflected the will of the majority the electees. Okei-Odumakin made the remark in an interview with our reporter on Monday in Lagos. She reacted to the winning of Osun governorship election  by an opposition party. It was reported that the Peoples Democratic Party Candidate, Sen. Ademola Adeleke, defeated incumbent Gov. Gboyega Oyetola to emerge the winner of the election. Okei-Odumakin, a rights activist, said that the electorate had spoken loud and clear on who should lead the state in the next four years. “We must recognise that the outcomes of many elections are credited to the electorate, and that is one reality witnessed in this election. “The outcome of the Osun election is, no doubt, the decision of the people.. Okei-Odumakin congratulated the Osun governor-elect, and urged him to deliver dividends of democracy to the people. It was reported that Adeleke polled 403,371 votes to defeat Oyetola, the candidate of All Progressives Congress, who secured 375,027 votes. Adeleke won in 17 local government areas of the state while Oyetola won in 13.
