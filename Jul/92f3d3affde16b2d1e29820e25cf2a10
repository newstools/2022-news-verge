Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, the Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), has called for the support of key actors in the transport sector to help reduce carnage on highways. Oyeyemi, represented by his Deputy Corps Commander, Mr Charles Edem, said this at the sideline of a-day safety campaign rally at Ota-fun Motor Park, Osogbo. Oyeyemi said the need for stakeholders to re-sensitise their subjects became paramount, hence the agency would continue to collaborate with them to ensure safety on highways. He said the corps would deploy ambulances, tow vans, motorbikes and officers across strategic corridors within the 36 states to ensure safe driving. According to him, roads are always busy, especially during the festive seasons with more vehicular movements. “There are specific corridors within the 36 states where accidents are prone during the festive seasons. “We have perfected our plans to ensure that we record zero accident during and after the Eid-El-kabir,” he said. He said the Corps would deploy officers at strategic spots during the Eid-El-kabir, and called on Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) and other key stakeholders to work with FRSC on safe driving on highways. Also, the Zonal Commanding Officer (ZCO) representing Oyo, Osun and Ekiti, Assistant Corps Marshal (ACM) Uakhemen Ojeamiren, said the zone was working hard to reduce accidents during Eid-El-kabir festival. Ojeamiren said roads were always busy with heavy vehicular movements during festive seasons. He advised stakeholders to join hands with the corps towards ensuring a zero accident during and after the celebration within the zone. In his response, Osun RTEAN Chairman, Mr Jelili Abioye, said the association would continue to collaborate with FRSC in its operational dealings. Abioye advised his members to maintain speed limit while driving on highways, with total compliance with the road safety regulations.
