This is contained in a statement jointly signed by the CLO Chairman, Mr Vincent Ezekwueme, and the Secretary, Mr Chidi Mbah, in Onitsha on Tuesday. The group described Obi as an astute and selfless politician who performed creditably as governor of Anambra. It said: “His natural inclination for common good, justice, equity, patriotism and morality has endeared him to Nigerians and beyond. “It is on record that he has introduced politics of morality, good conscience and fear of God. “This is manifest in his resolve to tackle and eliminate transactional politics, corruption, monetary inducements of delegates. “CLO joins men and women of good will in celebrating you and praying to God to grant you all your heart desires beyond measures.”
