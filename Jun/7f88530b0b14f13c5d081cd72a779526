The Oyo State Government, in collaboration with the University College Hospital, Ibadan, has commenced a three-day capacity building on Basic Life Support for the State Ambulance Medical Team. This is contained in a statement made available to our correspondent by the Oyo State Commissioner for Information, Dr Wasiu Olatunbosun, on Thursday in Ibadan. According to the statement, the training is being organized to improve emergency operations with focus on resuscitation of cardiopulmonary victims, both within and outside health facilities in all the nooks and crannies of the state. It quoted the Oyo State Commissioner for Health, Dr Taiwo Ladipo, as saying that the medical team should seek relevant knowledge to further enhance effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation operations. “The relationship between the Oyo state government and the University College Hospital is second to none, that is why we have experts from the college to train our health workers today”. “Training is important and every health worker is expected to undergo training once in two years because knowledge acquired in 2019 might not be sufficient in 2022”. “Cardiac arrest happens within five to six minutes, this is why the state medical ambulance team has to be proactive in order to rescue the victims,” Ladipo said. It also quoted the Director, Planning, Research and Statistics, Oyo State Ministry of Health, Dr Gbolahan Abass, as saying that medical teams and ambulances have been stationed at the entry points in Ibadan and strategic places in the state for quick response in cases of emergency. “We have 65 participants attending the workshop, selected from General and State hospitals, including representatives from the emergency units of these facilities”.
