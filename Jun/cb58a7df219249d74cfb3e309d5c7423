Chief Whip of the Senate, Sen. Orji Kalu, has called for the filling of vacant positions of principal officers in the Upper Legislative Chamber. Kalu, in a statement he issued on Monday in Abuja, said that the vacancies created during party primaries should be replaced without further delay. According to him, during primary elections by political parties and for Senate re-elections in particular, some senators, including principal officers, fell out with their respective political parties and switched to other parties. “This switch automatically overturned the principal office positions earlier held by the distinguished senators. “The vacancies created are expected to be replaced in earnest. “The vacant positions do not call for election on the floor of the senate. “It, therefore, falls on the senate caucus of the zones that produced the principal officers to select replacements from their zones,” he said. According to Kalu, the caucus is expected to write their party about the nomination for onward transmission to the Senate President.
