A 38-year-old driver, Silas Vincent, was on Tuesday docked in a Kaduna Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stabbing his passenger during arguments over transportation fare. The police charged the defendant, who resides in Goni-gora in Kaduna, with assault and causing grievous hurt. The Prosecution Counsel, Insp Chidi Leo, told the court that the defendant committed the offence at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium Roundabout in Kaduna on May 28. According to Leo, a fight ensued between the defendant and one Emmanuel Isaac over the N100 transportation fare. The prosecutor stated that in the course of the fight, the defendant removed a knife from his pocket and stabbed the complainant on his shoulder and back.

The Magistrate, Ibrahim Emmanuel, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. He adjourned the case until June 28 for hearing.
