INEC in Lagos State has assured residents of deployment of more Voter Enrolment Devices (IVED) to capture eligible applicants in the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CRV) exercise in the state. Mr Olusegun Agbaje, INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner in Lagos state gave this assurance in a statement by the commission’s Administrative Secretary, Mr James Popoola on Friday in Lagos.

The INEC boss said that the deployment of additional IVED machines will start from June 14. He added: The commission will communicate necessary information surrounding the deployment of the machines within the state to stakeholders and leadership of various interest groups. “All eligible citizens are thereby advised to remain calm and also encouraged to go to the nearest INEC registration centres closest to them. “The commission will continue to ensure a seamless and stress-free procedure for att Nigerians who wish to participate in the electoral process.” Our correspondent reports that the CVR exercise which started in June 2021 is billed to close on June 30 to allow INEC process the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) for new registrants ahead of the  2023 general elections.
