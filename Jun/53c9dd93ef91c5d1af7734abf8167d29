Gov. Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has approved the reappointment of Mr Ibrahim Kashim, as the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) with immediate effect. This is contained in a statement by Mr Mukhtar Gidado, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the governor, on Thursday in Bauchi. According to Gidado, the reappointment of Kashim was informed by his track record of sincerity, commitment and experience in the discharge of responsibilities. It was reported that the development came few days after Kashim relinquished his governorship ambition on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) citing personal reasons. Kashim had earlier resigned his position, joined the PDP governorship race and won the party’s primaries with 655 votes while Mohammed sought the presidential ticket of the party. Sequel to the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as PDP’s presidential candidate, the governor returned to the state to seek re-election for second term in the upcoming 2023 general elections. The PDP subsequently fixed June 4 for fresh governorship primary election with Mohammed as the sole candidate.
