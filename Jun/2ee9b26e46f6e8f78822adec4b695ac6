Sen. Bola Tinubu, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has promised to properly rehabilitate the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) of Bakassi. Tinubu, who met with delegates of the party on Wednesday in Calabar, said he would ensure the rehabilitation of the IDPs if he picked the party’s ticket and wins the presidential polls in 2023. He said that he was committed to the welfare and social-economic growth of Nigerians, hence the need to give every Nigerian a sense of belonging. He also promised to expand the Calabar Seaport, to attract more vessels into the state for economic growth. Sen. Tinubu told the delegates that he believed in the unity of Nigeria where each citizen was treated equally. “I am standing before you as a very successful man, having been a two-term Governor of Lagos State. I have what it takes to be the next president of Nigeria. “Dear delegate, I urge you to vote for me during the party’s primary election. “Calabar is a great city; I want to assure the people of this state that I will expand the Calabar seaport for more businesses to thrive through the maritime sector. “On Bakassi, I want to assure you all that if elected, I will ensure the proper rehabilitation of the Bakassi IDPs,” he said. He also promised to create jobs and promote small and medium scale businesses. Chairman of APC in Cross River, Mr Alphonsus Eba, said it was Tinubu’s effort that moved the APC from an opposition party to a ruling party. Eba said that Tinubu had the needed contact, capacity and mass network to change the fortune of the country around.
