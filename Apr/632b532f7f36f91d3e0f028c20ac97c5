The 27 European Union member states have agreed to send another 500 million Euros in military aid for Ukraine, top EU Diplomat, Josep Borrell, announced on Wednesday in a statement. Borrell said it was crucial the EU increased military support to Ukraine as Russia gears up for a new assault in the country’s east as “the next weeks will be decisive”. It is the third package of military aid the EU has agreed to send to Ukraine to defend itself amid the Russian invasion, in total, the EU has sent 1.5 billion Euro in military aid. However, in February and March, the EU had announced two previous tranches of military aid, each worth 500 million Euro, in a historic first for the bloc to arm a non-EU member under attack.
