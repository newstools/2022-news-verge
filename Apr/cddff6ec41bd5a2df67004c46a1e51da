The largest commercial drone maker in the world, China’s DJI, has suspended its business in Russia and Ukraine. The technology company based in Hangzhou in eastern China is “internally reassessing compliance requirements in various jurisdictions. “Pending the current review, DJI will temporarily suspend all business activities in Russia and Ukraine,’’ a statement on its website read on Wednesday. Ukrainian officials had said that DJI drones could be a security risk to both the military and civilians, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. They suspected that devices might have been tampered with by the company, and had expressed concerns about the use of drones by the Russian side. DJI reportedly denied the allegations. The company did not allow the sales of drones for military purposes; a spokesperson was reported as saying by the Wall Street Journal. The move by DJI was noteworthy, as it was such a prominent Chinese firm. The Chinese leadership had given its political backing to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Ukraine conflict. He blamed tensions due to the eastward expansion of NATO, calling that the main problem.
