Aliyu Zubairu, the technical adviser of Gombe united said it was high time technology was introduced into the domestic league. According to him, that is the trend in modern football management and Nigeria league should be working towards using technology to give more credibility to the league. “It is high time we introduced technology into the game; everywhere you go that is the order of the day and Nigeria should not be an exception.” On the match officiating, Zubairu said he had taken a vow never to comment on match officiating, adding that the job of analysing the officiating should be that of the League Management Committee (LMC). On his part, the chief coach of Kano Pillars, Ibrahim Musa said the introduction of VAR to the NPFL would “greatly assist match officials and make their work easier and better.” “On this note, I am in support of such introduction and I appeal to the LMC to have it in NPFL.” Our correspondent reports that in the match, Gombe United defeated Kano Pillars by a lone goal which was scored from the spot kick by Daniel Barnabas in the 65th minute of the game.
