The Police on Monday arraigned a 42-year-old businessman, Ifeanyin Ogbugo, before a Badagry Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos, over alleged N2.79 million fraud. Ogbugo, whose residential address was not provided, is facing a two-count charge of fraud and stealing. The prosecutor, ASP Clement Okuiomose, told the court that the defendant committed the offences sometime in September 2021, at Olodo Drive, Ojo area of Lagos State. Okuiomose alleged that the defendant obtained a sum of N2.79 million from the complainant, Ibrahim Anura, on the pretext of supplying him Mercury batteries. He told court that the defendant who did not supply the batteries, converted the money to his personal use. The prosecutor said the offences contravened sections 314 and 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos, 2015. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Chief Magistrate Fadaunsi Adefioye granted the defendant bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties in like sum. Adefioye said the sureties must reside within the court’s jurisdiction with evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The chief magistrate adjourned the case until March 23, for mention.
