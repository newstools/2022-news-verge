The Federal Government has urged all employers of labour to implement the 2019 minimum wage of N30, 000. The Chairman, National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC), Mr Ekpo Nta made the call at a news conference in Abuja on Thursday. He was represented by Mr Adighiogu Chiadi, the acting director of compensation in the ministry. “The ministry reiterates that all employers of labour are expected to implement with effects form April 18, 2019, the National Minimum Wage (NMW) of N30, 000 per month, subject to the section of the NMW (Amendment) Act 2019. “Any Federal Government agency that is yet to implement the NMW and the consequential adjustment arising in line with NSIWC circular that was issued in Nov. 2019, should clear with the commission if they have any problems with implementation.” “Agencies that were not mentioned in the circulars but were required to clear with the commission before implementation that have already implemented theirs without requisite approvals from the commission, should submit details of implementation for verification and rectification,” Nta said. He said that State, local Government, and private sector organisations are at liberty to consult the commission for guidance as they may deem it. The chairman said that the commission would monitor the implementation and compliance in line with the provision of the NMW amendment Act, adding that sanctions were also provided in the Act. According to Nta, any enquiries arising from this circular should be directed to the commission.
