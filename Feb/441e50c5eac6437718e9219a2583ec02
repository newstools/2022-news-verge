An Indonesian court on Thursday sentenced a House of Representatives’ former Deputy Speaker, Azis Syamsuddin, to three and half years in jail for his involvement in a bribery case. Syamsuddin, a senior politician of the Golkar Party, was found guilty of violating the country’s corruption law. He was said to have given 3.1 billion Indonesian rupiahs (about 216,000 U.S. dollars) and 36,000 U.S. dollars in bribes to Corruption Eradication Commission’s (KPK) former investigator, Stepanus Pattuju, and lawyer Maskur Husain in 2020. Syamsuddin did this in a bid to prevent his name and the name of another cadre of the Golkar Party from showing up in a KPK investigation into a graft case in Central Lampung District, Lampung Province. Damis also said that Syamsuddin’s political right to run for public office will be suspended for four years after serving his sentence. Syamsuddin was arrested at his residence in South Jakarta by KPK investigators in September 2021, and he resigned from his post shortly after his arrest.
