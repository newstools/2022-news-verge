Google filed a lawsuit against the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) after the regulator fined google 173 million dollars for obstructing Korean smartphone makers from using operating systems (OS) other than Android. Korean news agency Yonhap reported on Wednesday stating that KFTC’s decision was enforced in September. This came as Google was obliging local smartphone makers, such as Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, to sign an “anti-fragmentation agreement (AFA),” prohibiting producers to use modified versions of Android OS and forcing them to publish applications and games only in Google Play Store. Yonhap cited sources as saying that Google filed the suit on January 24 in order to overturn the fine and the order making Google to correct its policies and to suspend restrictions. Google said that Android’s compatibility programme has brought innovations and success to Korean developers. The decision “ignores these benefits and wound undermine the advantages enjoyed by consumers,” the company said as quoted by Yonhap. The tech-giant also applied for an injunction with the Seoul High Court, the trial will begin on Feb. 25. In August, South Korea’s parliament approved a bill, curbing Google and Apple’s payment policies, forcing developers to only use their payment methods. The bill was approved so local companies could avoid paying 30 per cent commission on every transaction to tech-giants.
