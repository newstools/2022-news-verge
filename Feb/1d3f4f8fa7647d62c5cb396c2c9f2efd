The new figures bring the total number of COVID-19 infections detected at the Beijing Winter Games to 385 since Jan. 23. The Winter Olympics are being held under strict coronavirus rules. All participants are completely separated from the general Chinese population, and this includes everyone from athletes to journalists. To detect infections as quickly as possible, every participant in the bubble must take a PCR test daily, after a first one on arrival in the country.
