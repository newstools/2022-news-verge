The Ogun Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said on Wednesday that two persons died in a tanker explosion on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The Sector Commander of the FRSC, Mr Ahmed Umar, told our reporter in Ota, Ogun, that the accident occurred at about 6.05 a.m. near CDK Company. Umar explained that tanker, with no registration number and laden with Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), was inbound Lagos-Ibadan Expressway when it exploded some few kilometers after the Sagamu interchange. The Sector Commander said that eight male adults, three vehicles and a Bajaj motorcycle, were involved in the unfortunate incident. Umar said that two persons died, while six other persons came out unhurt from the accident. “The corpses of the dead have been deposited at Idera Morgue, Sagamu,” he said. The FRSC boss blamed the accident on excessive speeding on part of one of the truck drivers. He said that the inferno had been put off by fire fighters and traffic has also been diverted to ease the free flow of traffic. Umar implored motorists to cooperate with the FRSC personnel and other sister agencies to reduce the time being spent in the gridlocks. He further enjoined motorists to drive cautiously and adhere strictly to traffic rules and regulations.
