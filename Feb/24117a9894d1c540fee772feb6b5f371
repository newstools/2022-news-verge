She tendered the documents containing the names, amount paid and receipts of each customers that petitioned the agency before the court. The Defence Counsel, Mr Richard Ogunwole, SAN, had earlier opposed the tendering of some documents by the EFCC. Ogunwole contended that the documents were not admissible by the court because they were mere photocopies and not certified true copies.

Agomoh subsequently adjourned the matter until March 1, March 2 and March 3 for continuation of trial.
