Mr Jekwu Ozoemena, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) HIV Trust Fund (HTF) says only strict adherence to UN Joint Action on AIDS (UNAIDS) 95-95-95 vision for 2030 will guarantee a HIV free Nigeria. Ozoemena said this in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja on Friday. He said that ending HIV required regular tests and treatment of 95 per cent of persons tested, 95 per cent placed on treatment, and 95 per cent viral load suppressed. “The UNAIDS 95-95-95 fast track strategy; 95 per cent of people living with HIV knowing their status, 95 per cent of people who know their status placed on treatment and 95 per cent of people on treatment with suppressed viral loads,” he said. The Chief Executive Officer, who expressed optimism in realising HIV free Nigeria, said that testing and treatment were imperative. Ozoemena said that stigma and discrimination were being orchestrated by lack of information, as well as religious bias. According to him, this remains a challenge in Nigeria. He, however, condemned moral judgments by people against persons living with HIV, saying that it was one of the biggest challenges impeding progress in the fight against HIV. “This is because HIV is mainly transmitted through sex and can be linked to the injection of drugs.” “People make moral judgments about how someone contracted HIV and this can lead to stigma internalisation.” Ozoemena restated the need for a collective responsibility by all to continue the advocacy against stigmatisation. He said that such collective advocacy would go a long way in changing the narrative, especially with the involvement of religious leaders.
