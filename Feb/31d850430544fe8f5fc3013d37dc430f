The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, says the house will consider specific provisions and recommendations contained in Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) amendment Bill. He said the house intended to ensure that those provisions served the desired goal of improving ICAN. Gbajabiamila said this at the opening ceremony of the public hearing on ICAN amendment Bill on Wednesday in Abuja. He said the legislative process allowed it to consider and implement other recommendations and ideas that could be part of the original Bill but were nonetheless useful. “The requirement for public hearing in our legislative process is an essential part of our legislative process.” “It allows the National Assembly to engage stakeholders and interested parties, citizens and in some cases, international partners in a constructive consideration of legislation.” “So that from the views of the many, we can arrive at the best version of the law.  In effect, these public hearings are a joint exercise at nation-building,” he stated. He stated that the contribution made could have a longstanding effect on the country’s future. Gbajabiamila stated that as long as Nigeria existed as a sovereign nation, ICAN had existed to professionalise the accounting vocation in Nigeria. He said the Institute had provided training and certification, adding that it had also ensured the enforcement of regulations and guidelines. This according to him is to make sure that members of the profession conduct themselves with the highest sense of integrity and probity. He said that at different times throughout its history, the institute had made contributions to public policy and governance in the best interest of Nigeria. “These are all valuable contributions, and as such, every effort to strengthen the institution is worthwhile.”
