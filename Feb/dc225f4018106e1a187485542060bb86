The Tinubu Northern Region Support Group, has described Chief Bola Tinubu as most suitable aspirant to lead Nigeria at the end of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure in 2023. Dr Danladi Hammandikko, the National Coordinator of the group, said this when he spoke with newsmen on Thursday in Yola. Hammandikko said that Tinubu has massive support among Nigerians across the country, because of his past records as Lagos State Governor. “Tinubu has done a lot for this country and we know that if he happens to be president, he will do more.” “I have gone round the 19 Northern states to make sure that we moblise support for him to became the president in 2023.” “The year 2023 is the time to pay back Tinubu for what he has been doing for the people in the North.” “This man has focus and determination, we are looking for people like him to lead the country and we are praying for him to succeed, we know that it is God that gives power,” he said. According to him, Tinubu has supported a lot of people in the North because of his posture as a national leader. Hammandikko urged philanthropists and politicians of like minds to support the presidential aspiration of Tinubu for the development of the country.
