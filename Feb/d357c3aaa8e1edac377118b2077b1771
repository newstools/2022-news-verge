Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa has presented the State NYSC Merit Award to four corps members for their outstanding performances during the service year. Fintiri made the presentation at the passing out parade of 2021 Batch ‘A’ Stream 1 corps members, on Thursday in Yola. Our correspondent reports that the awardees, Mark Ozugbo, Aliu Oyindamola, Yunusa Ikoh and Olorun Shola, received the award for outstanding community development services. Fintiri who was represented by Commissioner of Youth, Mr Aloysius Babadoke, said the service year had exposed the corps members to the realities of life and equipped them adequately for the future. He congratulated the outgoing corps members and urged them to follow the footsteps of their predecessors in the area of skills acquisition to be self employed and job creators. “On behalf of good people of Adamawa, I deeply appreciate your contributions to the overall development of the state, particularly in the areas of education, healthcare, agriculture and infrastructure.” “As well as selfless spirit and uncommon patriotism exhibited in the discharge of your responsibilities in your respective places of primary assignment and host communities,” the governor said. Malam Ibrahim Tukur, the NYSC Coordinator in Adamawa, implored the outgoing corps members to remain good ambassadors of the scheme and responsible role models to other youths. He urged them to avoid all forms of social vices, especially the get-rich-quick syndrome which has landed so many in prison. “I must hasten to add here that you got to work hard, put trust in God, and He shall surely bless and crown your efforts with success,” he said. Tukur commended state government and all stakeholders for their contributions to the success of the scheme in the state.
