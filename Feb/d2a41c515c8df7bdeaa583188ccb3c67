Three female post-graduate students at Harvard University filed a lawsuit, claiming that the educational institution for years ignored sexual harassment and intimidation by an anthropology professor. Margaret Czerwienski, Lilia Kilburn and Amulya Mandava accused the university of both disregarding allegations that John Comaroff had sexually harassed students for years. Also for allowing him to intimidate students by threatening their academic careers if they reported him, The New York Times reported on Wednesday. According to the lawsuit filed in Boston federal court, Massachusetts, Harvard allegedly ignored numerous alarm signs, which allowed Professor John Comaroff to sexually harass one student and harm her career. The report cited that the professor jeopardized the careers of two fellow students, who spoke in her defence. The Harvard authorities have found that  Comaroff had engaged in verbal conduct violating policies on sexual and gender-based harassment, but he was not found responsible for unwanted sexual contact, according to the newspaper. The professor was placed on administrative leave until the spring semester and prohibited from teaching for the next academic year.
