Multinational technology company, Ericsson, has launched Internet of Things (IoT) Accelerator to make connectivity easier for enterprises globally. Ericsson, in a statement on Wednesday, said that the accelerator would deliver a reliable and secure cellular IoT platform that empowers communications service providers (CSPs) and enterprises worldwide. It said that for enterprises, the IoT Accelerator Connect would deliver a unifying layer of packaged services to minimise complexity. According to Ericsson, the IoT accelerator would enable developers use tools to scale from one device to millions of devices seamlessly within minutes. “Devices can be connected at any time, including end-to-end device onboarding, with a cellular IoT-ready module instantly connecting the subscription to the customer’s network of choice.” “In addition, the solution makes it easier to connect devices to public cloud endpoints.” IoT Accelerator Connect advances digital transformation throughout the IoT ecosystem. “Ericsson channel partners can onboard more enterprises with greater ease and grow their business,” it said. Kyle Okamoto, General Manager of IoT at Ericsson said: “We are proud to make it easier for enterprises of any size to instantly engage and benefit from the world of IoT connectivity. Okamoto said that by offering plug-and-play simplicity, Ericsson IoT Accelerator Connect marked a major leap in transforming access to IoT connectivity. He said that the solution covers connectivity of devices, networks and clouds, while removing hurdles for enterprises, and communications service providers, among others, to accelerate the growth of their IoT businesses.
